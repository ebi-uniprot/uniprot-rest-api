#Step 3: Unzip it in a folder e.g. redis-7.0.2
# Step 4: cd redis-7.0.2/utils/create-cluster/
# Step 5: Edit script create-cluster to update BIN_PATH to redis installed in Step 1
    # e.g. BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin" on Mac
# Step 6: Run redis cluster nodes by executing ./create-cluster start
# Step 7: Create cluster by  executing ./create-cluster create
# After Step 7 you should be able to connect the redis cluster.
