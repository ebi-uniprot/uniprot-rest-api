AR   A-THAL.
DE   A form of thalassemia. Thalassemias are common monogenic diseases
DE   occurring mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The
DE   hallmark of alpha-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain
DE   production in the adult HbA molecule. The level of alpha chain
DE   production can range from none to very nearly normal levels. Deletion
DE   of both copies of each of the two alpha-globin genes causes alpha(0)-
DE   thalassemia, also known as homozygous alpha thalassemia. Due to the
DE   complete absence of alpha chains, the predominant fetal hemoglobin is
DE   a tetramer of gamma-chains (Bart hemoglobin) that has essentially no
DE   oxygen carrying capacity. This causes oxygen starvation in the fetal
DE   tissues leading to prenatal lethality or early neonatal death. The
DE   loss of two alpha genes results in mild alpha-thalassemia, also known
DE   as heterozygous alpha-thalassemia. Affected individuals have small red
DE   cells and a mild anemia (microcytosis). If three of the four alpha-
DE   globin genes are functional, individuals are completely asymptomatic.
DE   Some rare forms of alpha-thalassemia are due to point mutations (non-
DE   deletional alpha-thalassemia).

ID   Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins.
AC   DI-02714
AR   ACDMPV.
DE   A rare developmental disorder characterized by abnormal development of
DE   the capillary vascular system in the lungs. Histological features
DE   include failure of formation and ingrowth of alveolar capillaries,
DE   medial muscular thickening of small pulmonary arterioles with
DE   muscularization of the intraacinar arterioles, thickened alveolar
DE   walls, and anomalously situated pulmonary veins running alongside
DE   pulmonary arterioles and sharing the same adventitial sheath. Less
DE   common features include a reduced number of alveoli and a patchy
DE   distribution of the histopathologic changes. Affected infants present
DE   with respiratory distress and the disease is fatal within the newborn
DE   period. Additional features include multiple congenital anomalies
DE   affecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and
DE   musculoskeletal systems, as well as disruption of the normal right-
DE   left asymmetry of intrathoracic or intraabdominal organs. ACDMPV is a
DE   rare cause of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, an
DE   abnormal physiologic state caused by failure of transition of the
DE   pulmonary circulation from the high pulmonary vascular resistance of
DE   the fetus to the low pulmonary vascular resistance of the newborn.

DE   A primary amyloidosis characterized by localized cutaneous amyloid
DE   deposition. This condition usually presents with itching (especially
DE   on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and
DE   thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing.
DE   Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular
DE   and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both
DE   variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as
DE   a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a
DE   predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and
DE   thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can
DE   resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular
DE   amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge
DE   to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or
DE   rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is
DE   deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid
DE   bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The
DE   amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin
DE   filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of

DE   beta(0)-thalassemia, while reduced amounts of detectable beta globin
DE   causes beta(+)-thalassemia. In the severe forms of beta-thalassemia,
DE   the excess alpha globin chains accumulate in the developing erythroid
DE   precursors in the marrow. Their deposition leads to a vast increase in
DE   erythroid apoptosis that in turn causes ineffective erythropoiesis and
DE   severe microcytic hypochromic anemia. Clinically, beta-thalassemia is

DE   An opacification of the crystalline lens of the eye that frequently

DE   morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be
DE   static or progressive. CTRCT4 includes crystalline aculeiform,
DE   congenital cerulean and non-nuclear polymorphic cataracts, among
DE   others. Crystalline aculeiform cataract is characterized by
DE   fiberglass-like or needle-like crystals projecting in different
DE   directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens. Non-
DE   nuclear polymorphic cataract is a partial opacity with variable
DE   location between the fetal nucleus of the lens and the equator. The
DE   fetal nucleus is normal. The opacities are irregular and look similar
DE   to a bunch of grapes and may be present simultaneously in different
DE   lens layers. Congenital cerulean cataract is characterized by
DE   peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric
DE   layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The
DE   opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus
DE   as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually
DE   bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In
DE   adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction
DE   necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform
DE   cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular
DE   material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue
DE   is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation
DE   cerulean cataract.

DE   recognized: in the classical form or Cockayne syndrome type 1, the
DE   symptoms are progressive and typically become apparent within the
DE   first few years or life; the less common Cockayne syndrome type 2 is
DE   characterized by more severe symptoms that manifest prenatally.
DE   Cockayne syndrome shows some overlap with certain forms of xeroderma
DE   pigmentosum. Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum, patients with Cockayne
DE   syndrome do not manifest increased freckling and other pigmentation
DE   abnormalities in the skin and have no significant increase in skin
DE   cancer.

DE   severe disease are handicapped by widespread malodorous keratotic
DE   plaques. Some patients present with hemorrhage into acantholytic

DE   A neuromuscular disorder. Distal spinal muscular atrophy, also known

DE   group of neuromuscular disorders caused by selective degeneration of
DE   motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory
DE   deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists
DE   of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without
DE   clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of
DE   distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the
DE   legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal
DE   muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. DSMA4 is

DE   atrophy with denervation and normal sensation. Bulbar symptoms and
DE   pyramidal signs are absent.

AC   DI-02799
AR   DSMAX3.
DE   A neuromuscular disorder. Distal spinal muscular atrophy, also known
DE   as distal hereditary motor neuronopathy, represents a heterogeneous
DE   group of neuromuscular disorders caused by selective degeneration of
DE   motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory
DE   deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists
DE   of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without
DE   clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of
DE   distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the
DE   legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal
DE   muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs.

DE   develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and
DE   progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions
DE   (generalized dystonia) within about five years. 'Torsion' refers to
DE   the twisting nature of body movements observed in DYT1, often

DE   An autosomal recessive and severe form of adolescent-onset progressive
DE   epilepsy. Typically, as seizures increase in frequency, cognitive
DE   function declines towards dementia, and affected individuals die
DE   usually within 10 years after onset. EPM2 occurs worldwide, but it is
DE   particularly common in the mediterranean countries of southern Europe
DE   and northern Africa, in southern India and in the Middle East. At the
DE   cellular level, it is characterized by accumulation of starch-like
DE   polyglucosans called Lafora bodies (LBs) that are most abundant in
DE   organs with the highest glucose metabolism: brain, heart, liver and
DE   skeletal muscle. Among other conditions involving polyglucosans, EPM2
DE   is unique in that the inclusions are in neuronal dendrites but not
DE   axons and the forming polyglucosan fibrils are associated with the
DE   endoplasmic reticulum.

DE   of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and related glycosphingolipids in the
DE   plasma and cellular lysosomes throughout the body. Clinical
DE   recognition in males results from characteristic skin lesions
DE   (angiokeratomas) over the lower trunk. Patients may show ocular
DE   deposits, febrile episodes, and burning pain in the extremities. Death
DE   results from renal failure, cardiac or cerebral complications of
DE   hypertension or other vascular disease. Heterozygous females may
DE   exhibit the disorder in an attenuated form, they are more likely to

DE   Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [MIM:256450], also referred to
DE   as congenital hyperinsulinism, nesidioblastosis, or persistent
DE   hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PPHI), is the most common

DE   negative feedback regulation of insulin secretion by low glucose
DE   levels. In HHF6 elevated oxidation rate of glutamate to alpha-
DE   ketoglutarate stimulates insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta
DE   cells, while they impair detoxification of ammonium in the liver.

AR   FFDD3.
DE   A form of focal facial dermal dysplasia, a group of developmental
DE   defects characterized by bitemporal or preauricular skin lesions
DE   resembling aplasia cutis congenita. FFDD3 is characterized by
DE   distinctive bitemporal scar-like depressions resembling forceps marks,
DE   and additional facial features, including a coarse and leonine
DE   appearance, absent eyelashes on both lids or multiple rows on the
DE   upper lids, absent Meibomian glands, slanted eyebrows, chin clefting,
DE   and hypo- or hyperpigmentation of the skin. Histologically, the
DE   bitemporal lesion is an ectodermal dysplasia with near absence of
DE   subcutaneous fat, suggesting insufficient migration of neural crest
DE   cells into the frontonasal process and the first branchial arch.

AR   GSD4.
DE   A metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of an
DE   amylopectin-like polysaccharide. The typical clinical manifestation is
DE   liver disease of childhood, progressing to lethal hepatic cirrhosis.
DE   Most children with this condition die before two years of age.
DE   However, the liver disease is not always progressive. No treatment
DE   apart from liver transplantation has been found to prevent progression
DE   of the disease. There is also a neuromuscular form of glycogen storage
DE   disease type 4 that varies in onset (perinatal, congenital, juvenile,
DE   or adult) and severity.

DE   Hydrocephalus is a condition in which abnormal accumulation of
DE   cerebrospinal fluid in the brain causes increased intracranial
DE   pressure inside the skull. This is usually due to blockage of
DE   cerebrospinal fluid outflow in the brain ventricles or in the
DE   subarachnoid space at the base of the brain. In children is typically
DE   characterized by enlargement of the head, prominence of the forehead,
DE   brain atrophy, mental deterioration, and convulsions. In adults the
DE   syndrome includes incontinence, imbalance, and dementia. HSAS is
DE   characterized by mental retardation and enlarged brain ventricles.

DE   macrocephaly and coarse facial features, including a broad nasal
DE   bridge, epicanthal folds, a wide mouth, and full lips, can be
DE   suggestive of a storage disorder. About half of affected individuals
DE   are macrosomic and edematous at birth, whereas in childhood they
DE   usually have a muscular appearance with little subcutaneous fat.
DE   Thickened calvarium, narrow thorax, wide ribs, flattened or ovoid
DE   vertebral bodies, coxa valga, osteopenia, enlarged medullary canals,
DE   and metaphyseal widening of long bones have been reported. Cardiac
DE   manifestations such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular
DE   hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusions are
DE   present in approximately 80% of cases. Motor development is usually
DE   delayed due to hypotonia. Most patients have a mild speech delay, and

DE   Selective deficiency of immunoglobulin A (IGAD) is the most common
DE   form of primary immunodeficiency, with an incidence of approximately 1
DE   in 600 individuals in the western world. Individuals with symptomatic
DE   IGAD often have deficiency of IgG subclasses or decreased antibody
DE   response to carbohydrate antigens such as pneumococcal polysaccharide
DE   vaccine. Individuals with IGAD also suffer from recurrent
DE   sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections and have an increased
DE   incidence of autoimmune disorders and of lymphoid and non-lymphoid
DE   malignancies. In vitro studies have suggested that some individuals
DE   with IGAD have impaired isotype class switching to IgA and others may
DE   have a post-switch defect. IGAD and CVID have been known to coexist in
DE   families. Some individuals initially present with IGAD1 and then
DE   develop CVID. These observations suggest that some cases of IGAD and
DE   CVID may have a common etiology.

AC   DI-00654
AR   VWM.
DE   A leukodystrophy that occurs mainly in children. Neurological signs
DE   include progressive cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, inconstant optic
DE   atrophy and relatively preserved mental abilities. The disease is
DE   chronic-progressive with, in most individuals, additional episodes of
DE   rapid deterioration following febrile infections or minor head trauma.
DE   While childhood onset is the most common form of the disorder, some
DE   severe forms are apparent at birth. A severe, early-onset form seen
DE   among the Cree and Chippewayan populations of Quebec and Manitoba is
DE   called Cree leukoencephalopathy. Milder forms may not become evident
DE   until adolescence or adulthood. Some females with milder forms of the
DE   disease who survive to adolescence exhibit ovarian dysfunction. This
DE   variant of the disorder is called ovarioleukodystrophy.

ID   Male pseudohermaphrodism with gynecomastia.

DE   An autosomal recessive disorder that manifests, in males, as
DE   undermasculinization characterized by hypoplastic-to-normal internal
DE   genitalia (epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory
DE   ducts) but female external genitalia and the absence of a prostate.
DE   This phenotype is caused by inadequate testicular synthesis of
DE   testosterone, which, in turn, results in insufficient formation of
DE   dihydrotestosterone in the anlage of the external genitalia and
DE   prostate during fetal development. At the expected time of puberty,
DE   there is a marked increase in plasma leuteinizing hormone and,
DE   consequently, in testicular secretion of androstenedione. Hence, a
DE   diagnostic hallmark of this disorder is a decreased plasma
DE   testosterone-to-androstenedione ratio. Significant amounts of the
DE   circulating androstenedione are, however, converted to testosterone,
DE   in peripheral tissues, thereby causing virilization.

DE   treated with the postsynaptic muscle relaxant, dantrolene.
DE   Susceptibility to MH can be determined with the 'in vitro' contracture
DE   test (IVCT): observing the magnitude of contractures induced in strips
DE   of muscle tissue by caffeine alone and halothane alone. Patients with

DE   tissues, especially in the skin and hematopoietic organs. MASTC is an
DE   autosomal dominant form characterized by macules, papules, nodules, or
DE   diffuse infiltration of the skin, often associated with localized
DE   hyperpigmentation. Gentle rubbing of the lesions induces histamine
DE   release from mechanically activated mast cells, causing local wheals,
DE   erythema, and often pruritus, a phenomenon termed Darier sign.

DE   ophthalmoplegia), and the facial and bulbar musculature (affecting
DE   sucking and swallowing, and leading to dysphonia). The symptoms
DE   fluctuate and worsen with physical effort. CMS10 is an autosomal
DE   recessive, post-synaptic form characterized by a typical 'limb girdle'
DE   pattern of muscle weakness with small, simplified neuromuscular
DE   junctions but normal acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase
DE   function.

DE   A form of congenital myasthenic syndrome, a group of disorders
DE   characterized by failure of neuromuscular transmission, including pre-
DE   synaptic, synaptic, and post-synaptic disorders that are not of
DE   autoimmune origin. Clinical features are easy fatigability and muscle
DE   weakness affecting the axial and limb muscles (with hypotonia in
DE   early-onset forms), the ocular muscles (leading to ptosis and
DE   ophthalmoplegia), and the facial and bulbar musculature (affecting
DE   sucking and swallowing, and leading to dysphonia). The symptoms
DE   fluctuate and worsen with physical effort. CMS6 affected individuals
DE   have myasthenic symptoms since birth or early infancy, negative tests
DE   for anti-AChR antibodies, and abrupt episodic crises with increased
DE   weakness, bulbar paralysis, and apnea precipitated by undue exertion,
DE   fever, or excitement. CMS6 inheritance is autosomal recessive.

AR   MYOSCN4A.
DE   A phenotypically highly variable myotonia aggravated by potassium
DE   loading, and sometimes by cold. Myotonia is characterized by sustained
DE   muscle tensing that prevents muscles from relaxing normally. It causes
DE   muscle stiffness that can interfere with movement. In some people the
DE   stiffness is very mild, while in other cases it may be severe enough
DE   to interfere with walking, running, and other activities of daily
DE   life. Myotonia SCN4A-related includes myotonia permanens and myotonia
DE   fluctuans. In myotonia permanens, the myotonia is generalized and
DE   there is a hypertrophy of the muscle, particularly in the neck and the
DE   shoulder. Attacks of severe muscle stiffness of the thoracic muscles
DE   may be life threatening due to impaired ventilation. In myotonia
DE   fluctuans, the muscle stiffness may fluctuate from day to day,

DE   of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive
DE   weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of
DE   the distal muscles of the arms. It is classified in two main groups on
DE   the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary
DE   peripheral demyelinating neuropathies and primary peripheral axonal
DE   neuropathies. Peripheral axonal neuropathies are characterized by

ID   Niemann-Pick disease A.
AC   DI-02053
AR   NPDA.
DE   An early-onset lysosomal storage disorder caused by failure to
DE   hydrolyze sphingomyelin to ceramide. It results in the accumulation of
DE   sphingomyelin and other metabolically related lipids in
DE   reticuloendothelial and other cell types throughout the body, leading
DE   to cell death. Niemann-Pick disease type A is a primarily
DE   neurodegenerative disorder characterized by onset within the first
DE   year of life, mental retardation, digestive disorders, failure to
DE   thrive, major hepatosplenomegaly, and severe neurologic symptoms. The
DE   severe neurological disorders and pulmonary infections lead to an
DE   early death, often around the age of four. Clinical features are
DE   variable. A phenotypic continuum exists between type A (basic
DE   neurovisceral) and type B (purely visceral) forms of Niemann-Pick
DE   disease, and the intermediate types encompass a cluster of variants
DE   combining clinical features of both types A and B.

DE   A non-progressive retinal disorder characterized by impaired night
DE   vision. Congenital stationary night blindness type 1B is an autosomal
DE   recessive form associated with a negative electroretinogram waveform.
DE   Patients are night blind from an early age, and when maximally dark-
DE   adapted, they could perceive lights only with an intensity equal to or
DE   slightly dimmer than that normally detected by the cone system. ERGs
DE   in response to single brief flashes of light have clearly detectable
DE   a-waves, which are derived from photoreceptors, and greatly reduced b-
DE   waves, which are derived from the second-order inner retinal neurons.
DE   ERGs in response to sawtooth flickering light indicate a markedly
DE   reduced on response and a nearly normal OFF response. There is no
DE   subjective delay in the perception of suddenly appearing white vs
DE   black objects on a gray background.

DE   skin manifestation is pachyonychia, but alopecia and leukoplakia are
DE   distinctively absent. Patients have recurrent pneumonias that usually
DE   result in reactive airway disease and/or chronic cough. One of the
DE   most important extracutaneous symptoms is an increased susceptibility

AR   SIALURIA.
DE   In sialuria, free sialic acid accumulates in the cytoplasm and gram
DE   quantities of neuraminic acid are secreted in the urine. The metabolic
DE   defect involves lack of feedback inhibition of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase
DE   by CMP-Neu5Ac, resulting in constitutive overproduction of free
DE   Neu5Ac. Clinical features include variable degrees of developmental
DE   delay, coarse facial features and hepatomegaly. Sialuria inheritance
DE   is autosomal dominant.
